Info about the NoSSL folder:

This folder will store:

/nossl_sessions/key_<key-timestamp>/client_<hash of client-id>.php

In the client_<hash of client-id>.php file, the hashed message IDs will be stored. This is important as we 
want to protect NoSSL of being tempered with with resending messages.

E. g.: A client sends a NoSSL-encrypted login (username + pass) and someone on the same network intercepts this
message. Without being able to decrypt it, he/she could send it to login. To prevent this, each message will
get a unique message ID created by the client to prevent sending a message twice.
This will however not protect from a man-in-the-middle attack.
